I need explanation for the below, use simple english easy to understand
analogy, and the questions mentioned below also you can take reference 
for the output from the previous chats.

• Algorithm name: "name_of_algorithm"

• Explain what is the "algorithm_name"?


• Provide pseudocode in plaintext as well as like below format in the
  same row with two side by side column. (Below is just example)

    Plaintext:
        function insertionSort(array):
        for i from 1 to length(array) - 1:
            key = array[i]
            j = i - 1
            while j >= 0 and array[j] > key:
                array[j + 1] = array[j]
                j = j - 1
            array[j + 1] = key
        return array

    PseudoCode:
        function insertionSort(array):
        for i from 1 to length(array) - 1:
            key = array[i]
            j = i - 1
            while j >= 0 and array[j] > key:
                array[j + 1] = array[j]
                j = j - 1
            array[j + 1] = key
        return array


• Steps to visualize and with example visualization

• Code Example

• What is the time complexity and space Complexity? Step wise mathematical
  explanation of time and space complexity.

• Practise Exercise

• Is there any optimization way available? Only provide answer if
there is any optimization available else leave this.
